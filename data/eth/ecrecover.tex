Recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. The function parameters correspond to ECDSA values of the signature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] r = first 32 bytes of signature
    \item[] s = second 32 bytes of signature
    \item[] v = final 1 byte of signature
\end{itemize}
